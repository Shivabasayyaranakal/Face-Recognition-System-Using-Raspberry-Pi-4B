🚀 Face Recognition System using Raspberry Pi 4B
A face recognition system using Raspberry Pi 4B, OpenCV, and a camera module to detect and recognize faces in real time.

🔥 6. Running the Full System
Collect Dataset:
python3 Image_Capture.py
Train Model:
python3 Model_training.py
Recognize Faces:
python3 Facial_recognition.py
🛠 Troubleshooting
If OpenCV doesn't detect faces, check your camera connection.
If recognition is inaccurate, increase dataset size.
If an error occurs, try reinstalling dependencies.
🏆 Future Enhancements
✅ Improve accuracy using deep learning (e.g., FaceNet).
✅ Integrate with IoT for smart door access.
✅ Add a GUI for better user interaction.
